# Scaling Experiments 

The experiments described within the subfolders are the specific changes that are evaluated for the Research Questions in the Datascience Folder. The experiments for Batchsize (2.1), Mixed Precision (2.3), Pin_Memory (2.4) Num_Workers (2.5) describe the software changes for RQ 2. As 2.2 is only a hardware change, there exists a specific slurm files for it but no software change needed to be applied. 
The experiments for 97 models and shuffle are additional and show sideeffects of the enhanced scalability. 

All Experiments have been run between March and July 2024.
